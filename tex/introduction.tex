The client for this group project is \textbf{Atos}. They are a world leading technology consulting firm who serves a variety of global market bases with annual revenues serving over several billion euros. This year as part of their annual IT Challenge, the realm to be explored is \emph{connected living}. The team must deliver an mobile application which `Enhances peoples lives through connected living'.

The definition of \emph{Connected Living} differs from person to person, but Atos believe that it is homes, workspaces and cities all seamlessly connected through smart devices providing connectivity anytime, anywhere.  Consumers are always wanting to feel more connected to their workspace, their homes and their cities.  With this in mind, we have decided to take the approach of connecting people with music.  

Imagine being able to control and connect with the music in your surroundings, anywhere.  Imagine being able to walk in to a coffee shop, library, bar and restaurant and suggesting your favourite songs that then play through the public audio media.  Choona is an app focused around the `Connected Music'.  Our research has shown there is no music sharing concept that allows people to collaboratively listen, interact and suggest music to people in your surrounding area, home or business through an intelligent, cloud-driven playlist system.  

Choona is a public music player that lets you have a say in what you listen to in public.  It allows you to suggest songs you wish to be played at your location either right away or at a specified time.  It provides you with the option to like/dislike songs suggested by others.  Furthermore, you can connect through your mobile device allowing you to listen to the music privately (via your headphones).
